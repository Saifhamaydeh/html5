css stand for Cascading Style Sheets
its a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of
 a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## colors

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
1-rgb values ex :p {color: rgb(100,100,90);}
2-hex codes  ex :h2 {color: #ee3e80;}
3-color names ex:h1 {color: DarkCyan;}

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

Contrast
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.
three type of contrast high , medum , low

The hsl color property has
been introduced in CSS3 as an
alternative way to specify colors.
The value of the property starts
with the letters hsl, followed
by individual values inside
parentheses for:
hue
This is expressed as an angle
(between 0 and 360 degrees).
saturation
This is expressed as a
percentage.
lightness
This is expressed as a
percentage with 0% being white,
50% being normal, and 100%
being black.
